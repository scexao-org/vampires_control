Welcome to the instrument manual and documentation for SCExAO/VAMPIRES. This documentation is a mix of technical instrument information, API documentation, procedures, and checklists. The documentation is built directly into the python package ``vampires_control``, which is used for the VAMPIRES instrument control. Other important code repositories include ``device_control`` (hardware interfaces), ``swmain`` (SCExAO common tools), and others (TODO).

.. admonition:: Warning: ðŸ§ª Experimental and ðŸš§ Under Construction
   :class: warning

   ``vampires_control`` is still under development, and the API can change without notice. Use with your own caution (and consider contributing).
